Overview
============
Note: though useful, this project has been largely superceeded by:

https://github.com/zznate/cassandra-tutorial


Provides example classes for using Hector to access Apache Cassandra (0.7.0).
These examples were inspired by the same questions appearing reapeatedly on: 
hector-users@googlegroups.com from users with a big variance in skill level. 

The goals for each of these classes are: 

* be completely atomic
* be as simple as possible 
* have minimal dependencies 
* demonstrate a specific API call with the Hector client 
* sacrifice reuse and encapsulation for the sake of clarity


Each class can be directly executed via maven like so: 

mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.riptano.cassandra.hector.example.[class name]"

These classes assume you have an instance of Cassandra running on localhost:9160 with the default configuration. If this is one of the first times you have started Apache Cassandra, make sure you have loaded the default schema: http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/LiveSchemaUpdates
