Here are my comments. There is a lot of work to do to make it
presentable to the committee.

The report is too short.
It should follow the flow of a research paper.
In abstract and  intro, you must define the problem of your project.
challenges, and contributions.
Your current intro should be renamed to background section.
Also, you need an architectural figure showing all components,
including cassandra, and their interfaces.
Also, add statistics on the news you get per hour, during day or
night, % duplicates, add an example of duplicate news, time
experiments, graphs, and so on.

I gave the form to Prof. Tsotras, so ask him if he signed it and
delivered to Amy, or ask Amy.
